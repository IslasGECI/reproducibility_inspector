# Reproducibility Inspector

Verify that is possible to generate the reports defined in `analyses.json` for each Git repository
that [IslasGECI](https://bitbucket.org/IslasGECI/) has in Bitbucket.

This repository defines a Docker image that runs on a server defined in
[reproducibility_inspector_setup](https://github.com/IslasGECI/reproducibility_inspector_setup),
which, in turn, is provided by [provisioner](https://github.com/IslasGECI/provisioner).
